# Project Overview

## Package Name and Purpose

\[Provide the name of your R package and a brief (2-3 sentences) description of 
its purpose and main functionality.\]

# Progress Summary

## Completed Work

### Kate Esbenshade (ksesben)

-   Created summarize and compare functions for the package
-   Wrote documentation for the summarize and compare functions
-   Added LMP and Cities databases and combined them so that users can use 
cities as a proxy for LMPs

### Mack Smith (macks26)

-   Completed initial implementation of API wrapper object for CAISO LMP data 
using the Grid Status API
-   Developed methods to fetch data from Grid Status API, build the endpoint and 
queries for the API, and parse the data into a usable format.
-   Wrote documentation for the API wrapper object and method for collecting LMP 
data

### Student 3 Name (SUNetID 3) \[Optional\]

-   \[List major tasks completed\]
-   \[Include specific functions/features implemented\]
-   \[Note any documentation written\]
-   \[Mention tests developed\]

## Remaining Work

### Kate Esbenshade (ksesben)

-  Still have to write more functions for data analysis and visualization of the 
LMP data
-  Need to write documentation for the new functions
-  Need to write tests for the new functions
-  Need to write tests for the functions I already wrote once there is data to 
test them on

### Mack Smith (macks26)

-   Need to write functions that clean the data frame. Should take about at 
most a week's amount of time to complete.
-   Write documentation and vignettes for API object for users
-   Write documentation for the data cleaning functions
-   Write test functions to handle edge cases, especially for unusual 
argument combinations

### Student 3 Name (SUNetID 3) \[Optional\]

-   \[List tasks still to be completed\]
-   \[Include estimated completion dates\]
-   \[Note any dependencies on other team members' work\]

# Issues and Solutions

## Technical Challenges

### Issue 1: New Englad LMP Data

-   **Problem**: We originally tried to use the New England ISO API to get the 
LMP data, but it only provided 9 locations, 
one for each state and a few for the larger ones. This would not be enough to 
analyze congestion. 
-   **Solution**: We pivoted to using electricity data from the Grid Status API, 
where there is more specific LMP data.
-   **Impact**: This was a good fix, except that we eventually found other 
issues (below) and ended up changing the location scope anyways.

### Issue 2: LMP Location Data

-   **Problem**: With our original plan of the electricity pricing data from 
New England, we could not find the location data for the LMPs. It was only the 
LMP names, not any sort of latitude or longitude data so it would have been 
difficult to place it on a map. 
-   **Solution**: We pivoted to using electricity data from California, where 
there is more available location data.
-   **Impact**: There is not much changes to the functions or usability of our 
package, it now just focuses on California instead of New England. Because of 
California's many renewables and lower amount of transmission, the prices vary 
much more than in New England, so evaluating congestion may in fact be more 
interesting.

# Changes to Project Plan

## Scope Modifications

1. The main scope modification is that we are now using California electricity 
data instead of New England data. This will require some changes to the 
functions and documentation, but the overall structure of the package will 
remain the same.
2. We are also now adding a new feature so that this data can be visualized 
in an R Shiny App. This will require some additional work, but we believe it 
will add value to the package.

### Original Plan

This package will be used to analyze electricity prices in New England by 
location (locational marginal prices, also known as LMPs). The package will pull 
from the ISO New England API to get the most recent data on electricity prices 
and provide functions to analyze and visualize this data. We will use spacial 
data to visualize the prices on a map of New England. We will also combine this 
with shapefiles of transmission lines in order to visualize transmission 
congestion, which is a major driver of electricity prices.

### Modified Plan

This package will be used to analyze electricity prices in California by 
location (locational marginal prices, also known as LMPs). The package will pull 
from the Grid Status API to get the most recent data on electricity prices 
and provide functions to analyze and visualize this data. We will use spacial 
data to visualize the prices on a map of California. We will also combine this 
with shapefiles of transmission lines in order to visualize transmission 
congestion, which is a major driver of electricity prices. The maps and 
transmission visualizations will be displayed on a Shiny app. 

### Reason for Change

As described above, we were unable to get the location data for the LMPs in 
New England, so we pivoted to California data. We also decided to add the Shiny 
app feature to add value to the package.

### Impact on Timeline

Overall, the changes to the scope of the project does not significantly impact 
the timeline. Although we have changed the type of API we are using, the schema 
of the data collected remains very similar. However, the increase in complexity 
of our project will required needed for the project, but we are still on track 
to complete the project by the original deadline.

## Timeline Adjustments

This has pushed back our timeline slightly, but have made significant progress 
still with a few weeks left to complete it.

### Updated Timeline

-   \[Milestone 1\]: \[New Date\]
-   \[Milestone 2\]: \[New Date\]
-   \[Final Delivery\]: \[New Date\]
